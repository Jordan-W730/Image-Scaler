# most recent update: 2022 - 10 - 17
# changes made: added source code

# this code is relatively simple, however you will need to have downloaded pygame, and provided a valid source image in order for it to run
# the image provided will be increased in size by a factor of 4 and displayed on your screen
# this code can be adusted to scale to different sizes, simply adjust the following lines: 22, 38, 42
# in order to adjust these values, you'll need to change the scalar vlaues "4" to your desired value, please ensure you adjust them appropriately
